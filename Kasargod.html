    <img src="images/ananthapadmanabhaswamy temple.jpg" alt="Anantha padmanabha swamy temple">
    <p class="mt-3">Ananthapadmanabhaswamy Temple or Ananthapura Lake Temple is a Hindu temple built in the middle of a lake in the little village of Ananthapura, around 6 km from the town of Kumbla in Manjeshwaram Taluk of Kasaragod District of Kerala, South India. This is the only lake temple in Kerala and is believed to be the original seat of Ananthapadmanabha Swami Thiruvananthapuram. Legend has it that this is the original site where Ananthapadmanabha settled down. Babiya, a crocodile who lived in the lake, was also famed for being vegetarian. She died at age of 75 on October 9, 2022. It is believed tha she ate only temple offerings that were served to her twice a week and never harmed a single human. The lake in which the sanctum sanctorum is built measures about 2 acres. An interesting spot to keep in mind while visiting the temple is a cave to the right corner of the lake. According to the local legend, the deity Anantha Padmanabha chose to go all the way to Thiruvananthapuram through that cave. Hence both the places retain similar names, in spite of being on either end of the region. The current priests are Havyaka Brahmins, however the tantri belongs Shivalli Brahmin community.</p>
